This is my 3rd data science project at Metis/Chicago.

# Objective
I used classification knowledge in machine learning to predict whether a team is top 4 in the Spanish soccer league (also called La Liga), based on two main features of 'Goals scored' and 'Goals lost'. More explanation on the result: please refer to the presentation slides and my [GitHub blog](https://tangming2008.github.io/).

# Files were in the folder
1. jupyter notebook: main codes for data collection, exploration, visualization and modeling.
2. pdf: presentation slides
3. py: python code for the pre-defined functions, which are used later in jupyter notebook.
