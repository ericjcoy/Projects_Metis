This is my 4th data science project at Metis/Chicago.

# Objective
I used clustering (unsupervised machine learning) and sentiment approach to analyze the hotel review data, and built a recommender based on the topic modeling results. More explanation on the result: please refer to the presentation slides and my [GitHub blog](https://tangming2008.github.io/).
